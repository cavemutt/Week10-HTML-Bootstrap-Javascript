# Week10-HTML-Bootstrap-Javascript

This Magical Cat can see you, human... 

This assignment was to create a one page site using HTML, Bootstrap and JavaScript that has a Bootstrap styled form with a submit button that adds to a Bootstrap styled table. 

Using a combination of Bootstrap with some modified and custom-added variables, vanilla CSS and CSS animations, and vanilla JavaScript, Baz the magic cat will see some things about you, and display something different if the magic is clouded. In both cases, the assignment requirements are met.

This project uses two api's, one is free with no key, and one with a key on a limited free trial.
Therefore, this project will only be available as-is until the middle of October.
I am looking into learning how to hide api keys, but for now, if you want to be a jerk and steal it, it only works for this one usage and can only make so many calls per minute. If I see it being misused, I will end it's validity with the api. 
Thanks to Abstractapi.com and Open-meteo.com for this usage.

Remember, Baz will be watching you...
